
Suggested Improvements for the Star Schema

The suggested star schema is a solid foundation but has a few imperfections that could impact performance and usability.
For instance, dimensions like Dim_Product and Dim_Location are denormalized, storing hierarchical data such as ProductSubCategoryName and ProductTopCategoryName, which introduces redundancy and increases table size.
Normalizing these dimensions into snowflake schemas by splitting hierarchies would reduce redundancy and improve query performance. 
Additionally, the use of natural keys (e.g., ProductKey, LocationKey) instead of surrogate keys ties the warehouse to source system changes, making it prone to inconsistencies. 
Introducing surrogate keys would decouple the data warehouse from source changes and improve data integrity.

Furthermore, Columns like FullName in Dim_Customer may also have high cardinality, increasing memory usage and query complexity, which can be mitigated by avoiding such attributes in aggregations.
Adding indexes on foreign key columns in the fact table and ensuring the granularity of Fact_InternetSales meets reporting requirements (e.g., detailed shipping information) would further enhance performance and usability.
These changes would make the schema more robust, flexible, and scalable for business analytics.
